# NO2 pollution

About This Project
This project leverages remote sensing, GIS, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) pollution across Iran from July to September. By processing Sentinel-5P data, it visualizes NO₂ concentrations, highlighting pollution hotspots in major urban and industrial areas. The goal is to provide valuable insights for environmental monitoring and air quality management.

The code and visualizations can be used to track NO₂ levels and assess their impact on health and the environment.
